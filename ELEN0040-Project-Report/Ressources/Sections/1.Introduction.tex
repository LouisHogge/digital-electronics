\section{Introduction}

This project aims to implement a simplified version of the game \href{http://www.ponggame.org/}{\textit{pong}} by using a CPLD. The goal is to bounce the ball on the paddle. The simplified version consists of a single paddle that moves horizontally and a ball that moves vertically, the player has the ability to control the movement of the paddle in order to bounce the ball up. When the ball reaches the top, it bounces back in another column, which is drawn randomly. This version of the game was necessary in order to fit our game on this kind of microchips with only 160 logic gates. The game stops when the player fails 3 times to make the ball bounces on the paddle.\\

We chose to use a 5x7 LED matrix where the paddle moves in the row of 7 LEDs and the ball in the column of 5 LEDs. The paddle has a width of 2 LEDs and the ball has a size of only 1 LED.
