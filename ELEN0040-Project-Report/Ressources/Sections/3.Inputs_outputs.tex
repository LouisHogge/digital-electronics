\section{Main entity and inputs/outputs}

Here is the main entity of our game:

\begin{minted}{vhdl}
entity pong is
    generic(
        -- Constants
        SCREEN_WIDTH: integer := 7;
        SCREEN_HEIGHT: integer := 5;
        PADDLE_WIDTH: integer := 2;
        PADDLE_Y: integer := 0;
        NUMBER_LIVES: integer := 3);
    Port(
        -- Input signals
        CLK_SLOW: in STD_LOGIC;
        CLK_FAST: in STD_LOGIC;

        MOVE_LEFT: in STD_LOGIC;
        MOVE_RIGHT: in STD_LOGIC;

        START: in STD_LOGIC;

        -- Output signals
        LED_ROW: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(SCREEN_HEIGHT - 1 downto 0);
        LED_COL: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(SCREEN_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        
        LED_LIVES: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(NUMBER_LIVES - 1 downto 0));
end pong;
\end{minted}

\subsection{Constants}
\begin{itemize}
        \item[-] \texttt{SCREEN\_WIDTH} : equals to the LED matrix's width (7)
        
        \item[-] \texttt{SCREEN\_HEIGHT} : equals to the LED matrix's height (5)
        
        \item[-] \texttt{PADDLE\_WIDTH} : the paddle's size has been defined to 2 in this game
        
        \item[-] \texttt{PADDLE\_Y} : the paddle stays at the bottom so its position is equal to 0
        
        \item[-] \texttt{LIVES} : the number of lives has been chosen to be equal to 3
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \texttt{CLOCK\_SLOW} : the slowest clock from the CPLD
    \item[-] \texttt{CLOCK\_FAST} : the fastest clock from the CPLD
    \item[-]\texttt{MOVE\_LEFT} : button that moves the paddle one LED to the left
    \item[-] \texttt{MOVE\_RIGHT} : button that moves the paddle one LED to the right
    \item[-] \texttt{START} : button that starts or restarts the game with 3 lives
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \texttt{LED\_ROW} : logic vector which contains the lines of the LED matrix
    \item[-] \texttt{LED\_COL} : logic vector which contains the columns of the LED matrix
    \item[-] \texttt{LIVES} : logic vector that contains the number of remaining lives
\end{itemize}
